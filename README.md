# Mouse Catching Game
This is a simple game made using java in which a player must stop a mouse from escaping by trapping it in the playing field.

### How to play
The player initally chooses the size of the board either 4 or 20 squares wide and begins the game

Each turn the player will be allowed to place a new snake block next to an existing snake on the board.
The goal is for the player to encircle the mouse completely using the snakes that are already on the board.
If the mouse manages to escape to the end of the board, that is game over and the user can either exit or restart the game.
